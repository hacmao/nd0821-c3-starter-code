## Intended Use

This is a model used for research purpose only. Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.  

## Training and evaluation Data

Data was downloaded from https://anvilproject.org/guides/content/creating-links.
This data was created by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database.  
Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.  
Train data and evaluation data was split by using `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split` function with 20% for evaultion data, 80% for train data.
